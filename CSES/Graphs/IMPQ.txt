# 2_CountingRooms
# 7_Monsters - Multi source BFS
# 10_HighScore
# 11_FlightDiscount
# 13_FlightRoutes
# Difference between 6_RoundTrip and 14_RoundTrip
# 17_GameRoutes - uses dp
# 19_PlanetQueries1
# 24_FlightRoutesCheck - counting strongly connected component using Kosaraju Algo
# 26_CoinCollector - uses DP in Strongly connected component question using Kosaraju
# 27_MailDelivery - Printing Euler Circuit in Undirected Graph
# 28_DeBrujinSequence - Note how we reduce time complexity here
# 29_TeleportersPath - Printing Euler Path in Directed Graph
# 30_HamiltonianFlights - The Backtrack solution gives TLE on large inputs since it creates all possible permutations
# 30_HamiltonianFlights - The DP solution is acceptable
# 31_KnightsTour
# 32_DownloadSpeed - Edmond Karp caannot handle if there is multiple edges between two same nodes from u -> v.
# 32_DownloadSpeed - Dinic Algo can handle those edges and is better
